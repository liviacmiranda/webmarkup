		<h1>
			My life
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			My name is Livia Coppini Miranda, I am 21 years old and I am brazillian. I was born in São Paulo
			in 2001 and lived in a neighboring city called São Bernardo do Campo. In September 2017 I moved 
			with my family to Amsterdam, and a few days after my arrival I strted my high school education
			at an international school. The first year was focused on learning the language and in 2019 I
			began my HAVO education. I graduated in 2021 and decided to take a gap year to work and decide
			what I wanted for my future, which I inevitably choose IT was the best option for me.

		<h2>
			My trip to London, Paris and New york
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			During my gap year I also decided that one of the best way for me to learn about the world
			would be trough traveling. I then decided to take a trip to London, Paris and New York. From
			each place that I've been I bought a suvenir to bring with me. In London, I bought a small magnet
			of the london bridge for &pound;1. In paris I bought a small snowglobe of the Eiffel tower for 
			&euro;2 and in New York I bought a t-shirt for &dollar;6.
